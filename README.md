### How I created this personal site

GitHub allows every user a free website at url <username>.github.io. For that you have to create a repository as <username>.github.io. In my case it was **capitalch.github.io**
  
**I followed following process:**
1. Forked a minimal blog site from [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and named the forked repository as **capitalch.github.io**
2. Made necessary changes in **_config.yml** file and other files such as **about.md** and in _posts folder. Any file with proper datetime format you add in _posts folder will appear as your new blog post
