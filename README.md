### How I created this personal site

GitHub allows every user a free website at url <username>.github.io. For that you have to create a repository as <username>.github.io. In my case it was **capitalch.github.io**. In the process I took help from [Here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
  
You need to know markup syntax. To create a site you can start with any template provided by GitHub, fork it as starting point and customize the _config.yml files and post and pages. You are ready to go. In each project using github pages you can create a documentation site starting from some good documentation template.
  
**I followed following process to create personal site:**
1. Forked a minimal blog site from [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and named the forked repository as **capitalch.github.io**
2. Made necessary changes in **_config.yml** file and other files such as **about.md** and in _posts folder. Any file with proper datetime format you add in _posts folder will appear as your new blog post
